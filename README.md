# Single Machine Scheduling

During the course of Algorithms for Computational Logic at Instituto Superior Técnico, we were proposed to develop a software tool that solves the Single Machine Scheduling problem (JFS). In the first delivery we solved it with maxSAT while in the second we used SMT. Both solutions are in their respective folders in this repository.
